# file name is any type:- JPEG file, text file

#when you open a file, make sure you are closing the file

Writw/Read Functions

Write(string) # Any sentence, paragraph
Writeline(list) # List   []  [ , '', ]



read() - reads the entire content from the file
read(n) - reads n no of chars from the file
readline() - reads characters from the file till it encounters a (\n) new line
readlines() - reads the entire content from the file and puts it in a List


# Modes

r - Open file in read Mode :- It open already existing file only, if file doesnt exists then it will throw error. (Run time error)
    
w - Creates a new file, if creating already existing file then it will replace existing file and create new file

a - If the file doesnt exists then it will create a new file, 
    if the file already exists then it will open the file for writting at the end of the file, start appending at the end

# Exception Handling

you have to give double slash in Windows   when opening file     'C:\\Document\\folder\\filename'   ==WINDOWS

Exception:- Error happening during runtime


Syntax error = is not a exception


try

try: Code that may throu error
except: if there is any exception
else: if there is no exception
finally:- always executed
